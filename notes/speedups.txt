speedup notes:

in LoadFullGUI (bank 4), can remove the DrawSurfaceAndSky

in DrawSurfaceAndSky (bank 2), can remove the duplicate SetHorizonGFX

in (bank 0), can remove the duplicate CallDrawHalf3D

briefing text in bank 5 can remove the switch to katakana just for ï¾ž marks

in C:73C9 the calls before SetUpBriefing can be removed

DisplayTutorialLesson (bank F) can get rid of some duplicates, like CopyTutInstructorFromBuf

possibly save the line projections straight to the registers needed for DrawLine instead of to HRAM? faster + less space that way, need to doublecheck all places 2:400C is used though

7FB could use an xor a instead of ld a, $00 i think

fixes:
fix the 6 in segment-display number graphics?
fix the tunnel stoplight not displaying the first frame?
fix the radar base number graphics? (2bpp/AreaNums)
fix the tunnel's right side not damaging you ($3499.damageright)
should the lurches be flipped?
figure out why pause is unreliable
func745 is missing a push DE
the ball graphics table uses duplicates for diameters 8-5 when it doesn't have to
the call at 222C is in the wrong bank
DirectionTextNorthEast uses the kanji for West
the tutorial seems to always hard-reset the song whenever it's progressed
